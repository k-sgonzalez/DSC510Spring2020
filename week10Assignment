Course: DSC510_T303 Intro to Python Programming
Details:

-Create a program which uses the Request library to make a GET request of the following API: Chuck Norris Jokes.
-The program will receive a JSON response which includes various pieces of data. You should parse the JSON data to
obtain the “value” key. The data associated with the value key should be displayed for the user (i.e., the joke).
-Your program should allow the user to request a Chuck Norris joke as many times as they would like. You should make
sure that your program does error checking at this point. If you ask the user to enter “Y” and they enter y, is that
ok? Does it fail? If it fails, display a message for the user. There are other ways to handle this.
Think about included string functions you might be able to call.
-Your program must include a header as in previous weeks.
-Your program must include a welcome message for the user.
-Your program must generate “pretty” output.
